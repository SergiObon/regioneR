CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.8
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added new functionality to permTest to use multiple evaluation functions
      with a single randomization procedure. This gives a significant speedup 
      when comparing a single region set with multiple other features

    o Created a new function createFunctionsList() that given a function 
      and a list of values, creates a list of curried functions
      (e.g with one parameter preassigned to each of the given values)
      
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

    o Complete rewrite of randomizeRegions() resulting in a 10 to 100 fold speedup

BUG FIXES

    o Multiple minor bug fixes
